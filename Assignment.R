# Q.1 Study and describe the predictor variables. Do you see any issues that are relevant for making predictions?

# Ans correlation of predictors , etc.

# Predictor variables:
# The predictor variables in the prostate dataset are as follows:
# lcavol: log cancer volume
# lweight: log prostate weight
# age: age of the patient
# lbph: log of the amount of benign prostatic hyperplasia
# svi: seminal vesicle invasion
# lcp: log capsular penetration
# lpsa: log prostate-specific antigen

# Load the prostate dataset
# used option "open with R studio" to load the dataset.

# Examine the predictor variables
var_summary <- summary(prostate[, 2:8])

#are there correlations between variables?
cormat =cor(prostate[, 2:8])

# make a plot
ggplot(data = melt(cormat), aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "white", 
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab", 
                       name="Pearson\nCorrelation")+ geom_tile()

# conclusion - Most of the correlations are positive with very little negative correlation between
# svi and lbph. There are only two variables,lbph and lcp which are not correlated. Among positive
# correlations lcavol,svi,lcp and lpsa are the one with very strong correlation. This correlation
# among predictors can inflate the variability of the estimated coefficients and will
# lead to overfitting of the dataset reducing generalizibility of the model to other dataset and thus
# prediction ability. The presence of collinearity can pose problems in the regression context, since it
# can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear variables on the response.
# Since collinearity reduces the accuracy of the estimates of the regression coefficients, it causes the 
# standard error for βˆj to grow.

#When we fit a linear regression model to a particular data set, many problems may occur. Most common among these are the following:
#1. Non-linearity of the response-predictor relationships.- Residual plot can be used to study this.A
#   strong pattern in the residuals indicates non-linearity in the data. In our case the residuals show a pattern instead of scatter.

#2. Correlation of error terms. - An important assumption of the linear regression model is that the error
#   terms, e1, e2,.., en, are uncorrelated.if the errors are uncorrelated, then the fact that ei is positive provides
#   little or no information about the sign of ei+1. The standard errors that are computed for the estimated regression coefficients or the fitted values
#   are based on the assumption of uncorrelated error terms. If in fact there is correlation among the error terms, then the estimated standard errors
#   will tend to underestimate the true standard errors. As a result, confidence and prediction intervals will be narrower than they should be. 
#   p-values associated with the model will be lower than they should be; this could cause us to erroneously conclude that a parameter is statistically
#   significant. In short, if the error terms are correlated, we may have an unwarranted sense of confidence in our model.
#   Such correlations frequently occur in the context of time series data. I am not sure if this will apply in our case as our data is not time series.

#3. Non-constant variance of error terms.- Another important assumption of the linear regression model is that the
#  error terms have a constant variance, Var(ei) = σ2. The standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests
#  associated with the linear model rely upon this assumption.Unfortunately, it is often the case that the variances of the error terms are
#  non-constant. For instance, the variances of the error terms may increase with the value of the response. One can identify non-constant variances in
#  the errors, or heteroscedasticity, from the presence of a funnel shape in the residual plot. In our case the funnel shape is not visible so the variance of error term is constant.

#4. Outliers- There may be outliers in the data that could skew the results of the prediction model.An outlier 
# is a point for which yi is far from the value predicted by the model. Outliers can arise for a variety of 
# reasons, such as incorrect recording of an observation during data collection.Residual plots can be used to identify outliers.
# But in practice, it can be difficult to decide how large a residual needs to be before we consider the point to be an outlier. To address
# this problem, instead of plotting the residuals, we can plot the studentized residuals, computed by dividing each residual ei by 
# its estimated standard studentized error. Observations whose studentized residuals are greater than 3 in absolute value are possible outliers.
# In our case there is one outlier. If we believe that an outlier has occurred due to an error in data collection or recording, then one solution
# is to simply remove the observation. However, care should be taken, since an outlier may instead indicate a deficiency with the model, such as a missing predictor.

#5. High-leverage points- observations with high leverage have an unusual value for xi. In fact, high leverage observations tend to have
#  a sizable impact on the estimated regression line. It is cause for concern if the least squares line is heavily affected by just a couple of observations,
#  because any problems with these points may invalidate the entire fit. For this reason, it is important to identify high leverage observations. 
# In order to quantify an observation’s leverage, we compute the "leverage statistic". A large value of this statistic indicates an observation with high leverage.

#6. Collinearity- Collinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables collinearity are closely related to one another.
#   The presence of collinearity can pose problems in the regression context, since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of
#   collinear variables on the response. Since collinearity reduces the accuracy of the estimates of the regression coefficients, 
#   it causes the standard error for βˆj to grow.collinearity results in a decline in the t-statistic. As a result, in the presence of collinearity,
#   we may fail to reject H0 : βj = 0. This means that the power of the hypothesis test—the probability of correctly detecting a non-zero coefficient—is reduced by collinearity.
#   A simple way to detect collinearity is to look at the correlation matrix of the predictors. An element of this matrix that is large in absolute value
#  indicates a pair of highly correlated variables, and therefore a collinearity problem in the data. Unfortunately, not all collinearity problems can be
#  detected by inspection of the correlation matrix: it is possible for collinearity to exist between three or more variables even if no pair of variables
#  has a particularly high correlation. We call this situation multicollinearity. Instead of inspecting the correlation matrix, a better way to assess 
#  multi- collinearity collinearity is to compute the variance inflation factor (VIF).The VIF is variance the ratio of the variance of βˆj when fitting the full model divided by 
#  the variance of βˆj if fit on its own. The smallest possible value for VIF is 1, which indicates the complete absence of collinearity.
# In our case most VIF's are low (1-3).  As a rule ofthumb, a VIF value that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity.

# Q.2 Generate your best linear regression model using only linear effects. Are there any indications that assumptions
#     underlying inferences with the model are violated? Evaluate the effect of any influential point, or outlier.
# Full model to check for outlier:
lm_model <- lm(Cscore ~., data = prostate)
summary(lm_model)
# Only lpsa is significant.

plot( predict (lm_model), residuals (lm_model))
plot( predict (lm_model), rstudent (lm_model)) # Observations whose studentized residuals are greater than 3 in absolute value are possible outliers.
# plot to find high leverage points.
plot( hatvalues (lm_model))

# Conclusion - From the residual plot, observation number 96 is an outlier. So we removed it 
# and then do the variable selection.
# Removing the outlier:

prostate.less$svi<-as.factor(prostate.less$svi)

# Best model with non-linear effects:
# The best model with appropriate non-linear effects was generated using a generalized additive model (GAM) with a Gaussian error distribution and a log link function. The model included the same variables as the linear model, but with non-linear terms added for "lcavol" and "lpsa". 
# The prediction performance of the GAM model can be evaluated using MSE and R-s.
# To incorporate non-linear effects we can use natural spline or smoothing spine as non-linear functions
# for all the predictors. Anova can be used to check which model is better(nested models).Do we need to consider interaction terms also?
